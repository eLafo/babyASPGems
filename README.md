babyASPGems is a little project to Learn Rails 5

In this project we use all the layers of MVC architecture and work with sqlite, routes, gems, boostrap and jQuery.

Also use the XLS and PDF export of lists and more....

This project is grow up, please be patient. I publish all features in the future.

Happy coding!

Next steps:

- Private access to panel
- Work also with Postgre
- Use API REST for export data in PDF and XLS
- And what I can think of.....
